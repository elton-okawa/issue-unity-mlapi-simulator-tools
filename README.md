# Step to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Netcode -> Simulator Tools`
3. Set `delay` to `200` (we can leave others the default value)
4. Open `ParrelSync -> Clones Manager`
5. Click `Add new clone`
6. After a while, there'll be a option called `Open in new Editor` click on it
7. In this new editor start the game and select `Server`
8. In the previous editor also start the game and select `Client`
9. Now both client and server are running with the client making requests to calculate ping
